# A Multi Layer Perceptron Implementation of my own
This is my repo implementing a basic multi layer perceptron using numpy
It includes a backpropagation implementation for simple training
It includes two implementations, one that runs one input at a time, and one that takes advantage of batches and matrix math
It does not support GPUs
## Why?
Because you don't truly understand something until you've had to implement it itself
